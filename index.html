        <h2>Modere - Product Owner - February 2020 to Present</h2>
            <p>Worked with software development teams to iteratively deliver enhancements and value to websites, apps, and analytics platforms. Wrote documentation, directed research, and contributed directly to designing products.</p>
            <p>For over a year I worked with a team dedicated to our shopping app, which we maintained and enhanced on both iOS and Android operating systems. Our focus was on the app's user experience and on responding to the volatile nature of the sales industry.</p>
            <p>As a result of the reorganization of our department, I then worked with a team that owned a suite of tools that are continually maintained and enhanced for use by our distributors on a dedicated website. This played to my strengths because of my history as an Elite Service Representative years earlier where I worked directly with the distributors that used these tools. Conversations with users are incredibly valuable.</p>
            <p>Although the apps and the suite of tools were my main products, I also asked for the opportunity to work as a Product Owner for our analytics tools, which I took on as a secondary team. We integrated and maintained Google Analytics, Google Tag Manager, and other analytics tools into our websites and apps.</p>

        <h2>Modere - Business Analyst - November 2019 to February 2020</h2>
            <p>Facilitated the transition of our IT department from waterfall projects to agile development prior to being given the title of Product Owner.</p>
            <p>Researched, analyzed, and wrote requirements for new features to be built in our websites. Triaged bugs and wrote reports to describe expected resolutions.</p>
            <p>Worked with software engineers, quality assurance, and professionals from every corner of the company to create projects best suited to our complex needs.</p>

        <h2>Modere - Team Lead - Elite Service Representative - January 2019 to November 2019</h2>
            <p>Lead the team in charge of providing direct care and attention to our largest distributors. Created training programs and plans for my team as well as for support staff in our call center. Travelled to other Modere offices around the world to provide customized trainings for the adoption of new technologies and systems as they were added to our core business model.</p>

        <h2>Modere - Elite Service Representative - May 2017 to January 2019</h2>
            <p>Worked with our largest distributors to provide direct care and attention. Became a subject matter expert on our compensation plan and acted as a resource for our support team.</p>
